This project is about predicting the failure of the challenger based on different flight temperatures using logistic regression. 

1. Flight  :  continuous (Flight Number)
2. Temp    :  continuous (Temperature on the day of flight)  
3. Failure :  discrete (1 signifies failure and Vice versa)


## DS-510_Project2.pdf

contains the problem statement for the logistic model which is going to be built
   
## challenger_data.txt

Is the data-set which contains all the flight related information

## challenger.R

challenger.R contains the R code for the logistic model

## Project2.pdf

"Project2.PDF" contains the final report and conclusions of the project.

## Running the code

While running the R code make sure that you have included the correct path for the csv to file to be read in the line '2'.
replace the path for the code challenger <- read.csv("C:/Users/prana/Desktop/R Project/R Logistic Regression/challenger_data.txt", sep="")
with correct csv path.
